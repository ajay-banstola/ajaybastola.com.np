I want you and everyone else to **feel at home** when you post a comment on this blog.
    
The No. 1 house rule is simple: **Don’t be a jerk**.

Here’s what I like to see in comments:

*   **Weigh in with smart, informed ideas that contribute further to the article.**

*   **Provide useful, constructive criticism.** Spot a typo or an error? Let me know and I will correct it.

*   **Demonstrate and share the intelligence, wisdom, and humor you possess.**

*   **Don’t feed the trolls.**

Although I can’t be everywhere at once, here are some of the kinds of comments I am going to do my best to curtail:

*   **Promoting your own brand, product, or blog.**

*   **Impersonating authors or other commenters.**

*   **Comments that make it clear you didn’t read the article.**

*   **Comments that are completely out of left field.**

*   **Threats, personal attack — no matter how vague — against me or other commenters.**

*   **Racism, sexism, homophobia, you get the drift.**

*   **Trolling.**
